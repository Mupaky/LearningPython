She stands by the shore where the waves softly hum,The Black Sea whispers the song of her home,With curls that are tangled like the sea’s midnight foam,A beautiful girl with the world in her eyes.
The salt in her hair, the wind in her breath,The taste of the ocean forever on her lips,The laughter of seabirds stitched into her chest,She stands in the sun as it dips.
She met him one evening as twilight unfurled,He came from a land far away, far beyond,With eyes like a river that spoke of strange worlds,And a voice like the sound of a song.
He came to the village of golden-lit streets,Where lanterns swung low by the edge of the quay,He saw her from distance, her hair in a wreath,And his heart lost its way to the sea.
“What brings you here, stranger?” she said with a smile,The waves curling closer to touch her bare feet,He stuttered, “The stars brought me here for a while,” His heart, an anchor that dragged him to meet.
She laughed at his answer, a sound bright and soft,And pointed her fingers to stars overhead,“The stars brought you here, but the ocean forgot,To teach you the tides and the songs that they sing.”
He loved how she danced with her eyes closed so tight,How she moved like the ocean, wild and untamed,She carried the day in the folds of her smile,And he couldn’t resist calling out her name.
She showed him the waters where shells slept in peace,She taught him to feel how the sea swayed beneath,She guided his hands to her hair, thick and dark,And he tangled his fingers, afraid to let go.
She taught him her language in laughter and sighs,He traced words on her palm like a sea breeze at night,His hands in her curls as they watched the sky rise,Two shadows entwined on the edge of first light.
He told her of mountains and forests of pine,Of winters where snow fell in whispers and sheets,She listened, her eyes like the deep midnight sky,And wondered how love could be built on a breeze.
They danced on the sands until time slipped away,Until summer grew weary and autumn was nigh,They held each other as waves lapped at the bay,And whispered their vows to the darkening sky.
“You’re from another place,” she would murmur at night,“Will you leave me when summer fades into cold?”But his heart was the sea now, his spirit the tides,His love had become something timeless and bold.
He promised her always, and she trusted the sound,Of his voice like a river that carried her name,And together they stood on that Black Sea ground,Two souls now forever the same.
And when autumn arrived with a mist and a chill,When the boy had to go to his land far away,She watched from the shore, by the waves' gentle still,Her curls in the wind as he drifted away.
But he left her a promise, he left her a piece,A shell that he pressed to her heart as he cried,And she held it so tight, her heart on a leash,Until he would return like the incoming tide.
And each night by the Black Sea she waits by the shore,A beautiful girl with wild, curly hair,The waves curl and sigh, and they sing evermore,Of a boy who will come back to her there.
Her eyes scan the waves for a figure she knows,Her heart listens close for a faraway song,And though the winters and summers come and go,She knows, he’ll return before long.
For love, it’s a current, it’s a tide never lost,It ebbs, it flows, it returns, it stays,And she, with her laughter and wild sea-tossed curls,Will always be waiting, by the Black Sea bay.
